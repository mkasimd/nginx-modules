# nginx-modules
This is a github repo containing several useful nginx modules. This repo is intended to become part of the [debian-nginx](https://github.com/mkasimd/debian-nginx) repository such that the custom nginx builds may have the newest features enabled. By adding as a submodule, it is also easily achieved to configure any newer version of nginx without having to move everything around.
